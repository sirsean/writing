From [a Bill Simmons mailbag](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/100722/mailbag1):

> But you did stumble upon a fantastic sports movie idea: A die-hard Minnesota fan tortured by years of losing finally snaps after bumbling Wolves general manager David Kane (played by Greg Kinnear) signs overrated franchise player Ruben Tugg (played by Drake) to a franchise-crippling $120 million deal, then vows on a sports radio show to murder Tugg in the 10 days leading up to July 15 (when Tugg can officially sign the contract), prompting Minneapolis police to send rising star detective Jennie Jamieson (played by Megan Fox) to protect Tugg for those last 10 days ... and, of course, Tugg and Jamieson end up falling for each other, much to the chagrin of Jennie's boss (Bunk from "The Wire"). At the end of the movie, the fan somehow gets into the news conference and tries to shoot Tugg, taking down Kane instead, and eventually gets pardoned by the judge (a longtime Wolves fan) for saving the franchise. I like this concept because it could be a real movie (like a cross between "The Fan," "Big Fan" and "The Bodyguard") or a Skinemax thriller (and if that's the case, we'll make Jennie and her boss divorced, leading to the climactic sex scene when they get back together at the end). The title of the movie? "Expired Contract."

So we have this basic timeline:

# Act 1

- Franchise player reaches free agency, but is vastly overrated (baseball would let us do this nicely, with grossly bloated RBI/HR totals and high-K/low-BB ratio, with a high BABIP and a body type that doesn't age well ... like Ryan Howard)
- The GM fears that if he lets the franchise player leave, that he'll lose the fans forever
- He offers a mega-contract that will cripple the team for years to come (this would work better in the NBA, where there's a salary cap)
- Crazy fan threatens to kill the star before he can sign that contract
- Aside: it would be hilarious to give the fan a Twitter personality that's basically the exact same as Thrylos98
- Police assign a rising young star detective (don't they travel in pairs?) to the case to protect the player

# Act 2

- The cop sticks with the player and tries to get him to go by the book and keep his head down, but he doesn't want to
- There's a scare at a nightclub, and the player feels like he almost got killed
- In fear, he agrees to do what the cop says; they're at his apartment trying to figure out how to get one step ahead of the killer
- This is where they figure out that he has a Twitter account, and the cop starts monitoring it
- Female detective falls for the player (this part seems like it should be left out)

# Act 3

One possible ending:
- At the news conference, the fan shoots at the player, but his arm is knocked as he pulls the trigger and he takes out the GM instead
- The newly appointed GM cancels the contract offer and lets the player go elsewhere, where he's a big disappointment
- The judge pardons the fan, because he saved the franchise

Another possible ending:
- The detective figures it out and stops the fan just in time, and the contract is signed
- The franchise takes an immediate turn for the worse, and fans are left to wish the player had been killed

Another alternative:
- The crusty old detective takes the bullet, saving the player and the GM
- He is lauded as a great hero
- The player and GM see that people are literally up in arms about it, and they decide not to sign the contract

My favorite ending:
- The fan aims toward the front of the room, and the young detective tackles him as he fires
- Cut to black, without showing who died or what came of anything


########

Act 1

- Set up an ailing franchise, losing money and losing games; the team commits to spending more money to put together a champion, and their first order of business is to sign a franchise player to a huge free agent contract (but the player is old and not that good)
- This sends the Fan into a rage, arguing with people at the bar about whether the player is worth it
- The team makes the offer
- INCIDENT: The Fan calls a sports talk radio show and threatens to kill the player if he signs the contract
- QUESTION (page 17): How far would you go for your team? Would you kill to protect your team from a bad move?
- The Fan considers the question, and goes to purchase a gun.

Act 2

- The media is going crazy, totally villainizing the unknown Fan; they characterize him as a crazy person
- This only steels his resolve
- The team makes a move, adding some viable role players and clearing cap space; it's a good move and the Fan likes it. He begins to worry that he's overreacting, and that the team could still be good even with the contract.
- He talks to other fans, who don't know he made the threat. Some say the guy is crazy, but others are supporting, saying it's the only way the team will learn.

Act 3

# Page 1

# Inciting incident

The crazy fan goes on talk radio and says that if the player signs the contract, that he's a dead man

# Page 17 (lay out the essential character conflict)

The question is: do you let a threat on your life change who you are? Does the GM rescind the offer? Does the player decide not to take the deal, and to go to another team? Or do they plow forward, casting risk to the wind?

As a fan: how much do you care about your team? Do you care enough to actually kill someone?

# Climax

# The end

## Cast of characters:

GM
- Bumbler who's always making questionable moves, and the fans don't trust him at all

Franchise player
- Has numbers that look good on the surface, but could easily be replaced by any number of other players
- Seems phony, and the fans aren't as connected to him as the team thinks they are

Crazy fan
- Total diehard; lives alone in a small apartment stuffed with team paraphernalia
- Tweets crazy things all the time, living and dying with each game

Young rising star detective
- Female hotshot, gets all the toughest cases and plenty of glamorous ones

Crusty old partner detective
- Seen everything, doesn't care about anything any more
- No family, nothing to retire to, the badge is his life
