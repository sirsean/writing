Holy crap, folks.

According to a [tweet from the Brewers](http://twitter.com/Brewercom/status/5482949269)*, the Twins have traded Carlos Gomez to the Brewers for JJ Hardy.

I'm going to let that sink in for a second.

Yes, Wild Bill Smith has done some more dealing. He just unloaded one of the last (disappointing) pieces we got from the Mets for Johan Santana ... for a promising shortstop entering his prime years (he'll be 27 in 2010).

Gomez and Hardy are both coming off down years in 2009; before this season, Hardy was widely viewed as an upcoming star in the game, posting WAR totals of +4.5 and +4.9 (All Star caliber totals) before crashing to +1.4 wins in an injury-plagued 2009 season. Gomez, meanwhile, played himself out of the Twins' outfield by posting a typically terrible offensive line accompanied by a significant step back in terms of his defense.

This move helps the Brewers shed some salary, as Hardy is entering his third year of arbitration and is probably set to make around $6-7M this season. The Twins, moving into their new stadium, are in position to add some payroll, and this is a strong move that does that while helping the team considerably.

The shortstop question is answered, loudly, for 2010 ... and there's no reason the Twins can't ink Hardy to a long term extension midseason if they like the cut of his jib. Or get draft picks as compensation if he leaves as a free agent -- Hardy is probably set to be _at least_ a Type B free agent. A big year would make him a Type A. But given the dearth of quality middle infield options in the upper levels of the Twins' system, I'd say an extension is more likely.

Meanwhile, the Twins have sacrificed some excellent CF defense by losing Gomez -- and, importantly, some excellent corner-OF defense by having to move Span to a permanent position in CF. Span is a mediocre defensive CF and an elite defensive RF; this move promises more playing time to Delmon Young in LF,* and removes elite defense from both Gomez and Span.

_* Unless Gardy finally switches Young and Cuddyer now that the baggy is no longer a consideration?_

At the same time, the offense is set to look a whole lot better with this acquisition. Hardy is solid defensively, and has the potential to be a top offensive performer from the shortstop position. He doesn't have much in the way of plate discipline, but does have some good pop in his bat. I can see Gardy sliding him into the 2-hole, where he'd be a better option than everyone but Mauer, or to shore up the bottom of the lineup.

All in all, I think this is a fantastic move for the Twins. It's definitely a win-now move, too, which presumably will send a message to Joe Mauer _and_ to prospective free agents that the Twins aren't playing around.
