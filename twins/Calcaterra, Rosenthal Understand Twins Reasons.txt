[Craig Calcaterra links](http://bases.nbcsports.com/2009/11/sunday-morning-rumors-comin-down.html.php) to [Ken Rosenthal's take on the Twins' moves](http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/10336974/Padres-may-be-open-to-dealing-stars) this week, explaining:

> Rosenthal thinks that the Twins' moves thus far -- trading for Hardy; exercising Michael Cuddyer's option -- are all a part of the plan to get Mauer locked up long-term. They were probably the right moves independent of that, but I tend to agree that the Twins are doing what they can to make sure Mauer can't play the only non-monetary get-out-of-Minnesota card at his disposal, and that's claiming that the Twins aren't committed to winning.

I agree completely with Calcaterra here, and this is part of what I've been trying to say about these moves the past few days.

While Calcaterra unabashedly hates the Twins,* his Twins-related analysis is, as usual, quite even-handed.

_* He's a Braves fan, and hasn't forgiven us for winning in 1991. I'm pretty sure you can't fault him for that. At least, I don't._

Hopefully these Mauer-wooing moves successfully woo Mauer.
