We tried to make a t-shirt once in the past, the "Free Jason Kubel" shirt -- it was a cool shirt, I thought, but we had it made shortly before Kubel _was_ freed and took advantage of it by establishing himself as one of the best hitter on the team and assuring himself a spot in the lineup. Whenever I wear it, I get quizzical looks and questions like "Who is Jason Kubel, some sort of political prisoner?" or, more rarely, "Why does Kubel need to be freed? Isn't he good?"

So maybe it's time for a [new t-shirt](http://threebellesoil.spreadshirt.com/span-fan-A5790536/customize/color/70), one that won't be obsolete immediately.

Let's see ... we want a young, popular (but not _too_ popular just yet) player, under contract for several years, with potential to improve and -- why don't I just stop right there. You know what I'm getting at.

Introducing the brand new, [FireGardy.com exclusive Span Fan t-shirt](http://threebellesoil.spreadshirt.com/span-fan-A5790536/customize/color/70)!

You can customize the color of the sleeves if you want -- I just went with the standard black sleeves. Since mine was delivered, I've worn it constantly.

I know for a fact that FunBobby will be wearing his to Opening Day -- so look for the guy who looks like a happier version of Glen Perkins wearing an awesome Span Fan t-shirt, and feel free to get jealous that your t-shirt is so lacking in coolness. Then solve that problem by [getting your very own Span Fan shirt](http://threebellesoil.spreadshirt.com/span-fan-A5790536/customize/color/70).

Sorry about the blatant self-promotion. Of course, we'll try to keep this kind of crap to a minimum (which I think we've done over the years).
