> thanks to Commissioner Bud Selig's decision to turn recommendations for on-field matters over to a newly created version of the NFL's Competition Committee, the DH rule could face its first real threat since the American League accepted it permanently for the 1976 season, after a three-year experiment that began as a way to create run scoring and increase attendance.

It started as a way to create run scoring and increase attendance. It was successful: the scoring is consistently higher in the AL than in the NL, and attendance has skyrocketed.

SHOW AL vs NL RUN SCORING OVER THE YEARS

LOOK UP AND SHOW AL vs NL ATTENDANCE

> Forced to build deeper rosters because of the DH rule, the AL has had an upper hand against the NL in recent years -- a trend borne out in results from the All-Star Game, the World Series and in interleague play. AL teams have been bigger spenders than their NL counterparts.

In addition to scoring more runs, drawing more fans, and being generally more exciting ... the other problem is that the teams get better on the field.

Surely, that's something the league would want to stamp out ASAP!

Seriously, if they're going to make a change, why not _add the DH to the National League_? Maybe it'd lead to increased scoring, more excitement, more fans, and restoring the balance of power between the leagues?

Is that something, maybe, that people want? Or is it unchangeable because of some "tradition" that's really not all that old if you think about it?
