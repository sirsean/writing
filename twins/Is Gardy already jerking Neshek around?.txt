All spring, I've been hopeful that Pat Neshek would make the team and we'd get to see that funky delivery -- and all those strikeouts! -- in early April. The first time I actually saw him pitch was this week against the Red Sox, and his stuff looked filthy. He was hitting his spots with tons of movement, and the Red Sox hitters were totally off balance.

I mentioned it on Twitter and got a quick response from Neshek himself, who apparently watches his name online as eagerly as he watches the speedometer when he's on the mound:

> [@sirsean](http://twitter.com/sirsean) Thank you...I was scoreboard checking and noticed a few 89's...Lavelle is reporting my high at 88...false journalism! -- [@PatNeshek](http://twitter.com/PatNeshek/status/10964781477)

> [@sirsean](http://twitter.com/sirsean) That was the best my slider has felt since the surgery...glad to have that pitch working -- [@PatNeshek](http://twitter.com/PatNeshek/status/10964952992)

I think it's awesome that he responded directly to me about that, and I think it's encouraging that his velocity is almost all the way back, and that his slider might be getting back as well. Could it be that Neshek is almost ready?

Well, it turns out that [Gardy doesn't really want to find out](http://www.fanfeedr.com/mlb/2010/03/26/neshek-needs-to-show-he-doesnt-need-extra-rest).

> Manager Ron Gardenhire said Thursday that the next step is for Neshek to pitch with one day's rest -- Friday then Sunday. Other Twins relievers have started throwing on back-to-back days.

So he's _finally_ going to go down to one day of rest, well-delayed compared to the rest of the relievers. I'd like to know why. What does Neshek have to say about it?

> Been ready to throw back 2 back days from day 1, never mentioned soreness being an issue 1 time, this upsets me. [http://bit.ly/aRdLHD] -- [@PatNeshek](http://twitter.com/PatNeshek/status/11071316431)

According to Neshek, he's ready to go back to back days just like everyone else, and hasn't needed to be babied like this. There's something to be said for caution, especially with a valuable member of the team who's returning from injury. But we're a week away from Opening Day, and the schedule Gardy's set for Neshek seems to say he never planned on letting him make the team from the beginning.

> "If they can't bounce back on a day-to-day basis, it's hard to keep guys like that in the bullpen," Gardenhire said. "You can't have all these guys out here that need two or three days off after they throw, especially early in the season. So we're waiting to see where everybody's at."

How long are you going to wait? Too long?
