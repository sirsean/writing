I've thought for a while that a pitcher can help out his defense by working quickly and throwing strikes. When I was young and still played, I found that being in the field was a whole lot more fun when the pitcher was putting the ball over the plate (and, in turn, the batters were putting the ball in play). If you can reasonably expect a ball to be hit at you at any time, you're engaged the entire time -- and if you're not, the manager notices your crappy defense and attitude sticking out from the rest of the team who _are_ engaged.

On the other hand, when the pitcher couldn't find the zone, was stalling between pitches, and was walking guys, I wasn't alone among the fielders in getting bored. And when you're bored, you're less ready to leap into action on the off-chance the ball actually does come into play.

So one area in which I think defensive metrics have plenty of room to improve is in figuring out just how much this interplay between a pitcher and his fielders _exists_ and (more importantly) how much it _matters_ to run prevention. Does the efficacy of the defense change depending on anything the pitcher does? When Scott Baker or Mark Buehrle work quickly, does their defense play better than when another pitcher wastes as much time as he can out there? Does Kevin Slowey's propensity to pound the strike zone encourage his defenders to stay more alert than, say, Clayton Kershaw or AJ Burnett?

I don't know. Nobody has any numbers for that yet.

But there's also the possibility that this interplay works in the opposite direction. [From an interview with CJ Wilson](http://espn.go.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/2753/are-we-still-undercounting-fielding):

> The moral of the story is that a guy like me or Feldman or whatever, who was a reliever, that wants to be a starter for Texas, that should be just an overall positive thing that the organization has come a long way (from years ago) when we had such a stigma attached to being a pitcher in Texas. Now, it's like people are really excited to play here, to pitch with Elvis Andrus at shortstop, and Mike Young at third base, and Kinsler at second and Chris Davis at first. For me, that's a big thing for us, is that our defense is so much better that people are excited to be pitchers now for us.

And that's definitely interesting. For the longest time, pitchers didn't want to pitch in Arlington, and free agents wouldn't sign with the Rangers for that very reason. At the time, everyone blamed that on the "bandbox" nature of the stadium; after all, pitchers don't want to pitch in an environment virtually guaranteed to induce more home runs.

But maybe, just maybe, it was never the stadium after all? If pitchers don't like giving up home runs, maybe the reason is that they just don't like giving up _runs_ in the first place. And there's no doubt that for many years, the Rangers were an offensively-oriented team, with sluggers and run producers throughout the lineup but nary a defensive whiz to be found.

And that's changing now; they have a strong defensive infield and a small outfield that minimizes the impact of their outfielders' range. And suddenly the pitchers are a lot happier.

One of the reasons Twins fans are excited about 2010 is the drastically improved middle infield -- JJ Hardy and Orlando Hudson figure to combine for some good-to-excellent defense, and third base is Punto's best position (ie, the one at which he plays the best defense).

I don't think it's possible to guess how many runs the Twins' new infield will save over 2009; but we can take a look at some UZR numbers and compare them.

# 2009 Twins infield

_Actual 2009 UZR/150, sorted by playing time (decreasing)_

- 2B: Nick Punto: 9.4 UZR/150, Alexi Casilla: -20.9 UZR/150, Matt Tolbert: -12.7 UZR/150
- 3B: Joe Crede: 23.4 UZR/150, Brendan Harris: -26.3 UZR/150, Brian Buscher: -12.2 UZR/150, Matt Tolbert: 10.6 UZR/150
- SS: Orlando Cabrera: -14.8 UZR/150, Nick Punto: 4.7 UZR/150, Brendan Harris: -14.8 UZR/150

# 2010 Twins infield

_Career UZR/150_

- 2B: Orlando Hudson: 2.6 UZR/150
- 3B: Nick Punto: 19.9 UZR/150
- SS: JJ Hardy: 11.2 UZR/150

Hudson is getting older and his defense probably won't be as good as everyone thinks it is -- but there's little chance he's as bad at it as Casilla and Tolbert were in 2009. Meanwhile, 3B stays close to constant with Punto manning it most of the time, and SS takes a _huge_ jump up.

Now, I don't think these numbers can tell us _how much_ the Twins' run prevention will improve in 2010.* But I think it's fair to say that the improved infield defense _will_ help with preventing runs -- though less than it might given the staff's propensity for giving up fly balls.

_* But if you believe UZR is an accurate statistic, we're talking in the range of 3-5 wins. As in, the Twins got 5 wins better simply by improving the infield defense, without taking into account the offensive production of either Hardy or Hudson. Like I said, maybe UZR can't be trusted. Either way, this sounds like a whole lot of improvement. More than I would have guessed ... and it sure paints the projections of the Twins struggling to reach 85 wins in a different light._

So this summer, when all the Twins' pitchers seem happier than usual, will it be because of their lower ERAs? Or will both the happiness _and_ the lower ERAs be because of the improved defense?
