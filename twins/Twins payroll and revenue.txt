I've been thinking a little bit about the Twins' payroll lately. I have this feeling, too, that a lot of Twins fans are thinking about the payroll too. I wrote recently about the Twins' reinvestment rate -- that they're only investing 41% of their revenue in their payroll while _also_ racking up the 4th lowest revenue in the majors.

On one level, I remain somewhat confused about how the Twins have just the 4th lowest revenue in the league, despite ranking among the league leaders in _both_ television viewers _and_ attendance. That, I think, goes to show you just how bad the Twins' deal with the Metrodome is. It shouldn't be too much of a surprise if the overall amount of money generated by the stadium increases dramatically in 2010 -- everyone expects this to happen, because that's what _always_ happens when a new stadium opens. But what people don't seem to be expecting, because it's not typical, is that the team will also get a higher percentage of the stadium's revenue. There should be a lot more money available for the team -- especially if they can get some more profitable TV and radio deals.

In [this article](http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_13775169?nclick_check=1), Tom Powers speculates on just how much we can expect the payroll to increase. He quotes team president Dave St. Peter as saying that the goal for 2010 is to get revenue to "net zero" -- which means that the Twins would finally get _no revenue sharing money_ from the league.

> "We certainly have been a recipient," [St. Peter] said. "We hope to be a high-performing middle-market team in terms of revenue. My goal is net zero, which means we would not be subsidized by Major League Baseball."

That's a grand goal -- but it's unclear what that will actually mean for the payroll. My previous article about the Twins' reinvestment rate was not clear whether that 4th-lowest revenue figure included their revenue sharing money or not; my guess was that it did not. Therefore, an increase in actual revenues that is just enough to remove the benefits of revenue sharing isn't actually an increase in available funds.

What it _would_ do, though, is change that reinvestment rate percentage. If the team's revenue more accurately represents their available funds, and the payroll stays the same, then the reinvestment percentage would drop accordingly.* And I don't think the Twins think they can get away with something like that, on a PR level.

_* I feel like this shouldn't warrant an explanation, but I feel like that about a lot of things and it always seems to turn out that I was wrong. So let's imagine: the Twins' reported revenue increases from $158M to $200M. At $158M, their $65M payroll comes out to 41%. At first glance, there are two conflicting ways to look at this: if the payroll stays the same, $65M would be just 32.5%; if the rate stays the same, 41% would be $82M. But what if the Twins are currently getting $10-20M or so in revenue sharing money? (Note that I don't know if that's an accurate figure. This is just a thought experiment.) Their **effective** reinvestment rate is not currently 41% ... it'd be more like 36.5%. If the unreported revenue sharing money goes away, maybe we could expect the effective rate to stay the same, and the payroll would go to $73M. Maybe we could expect them to increase the rate to a real 41%, and actually spend $82M. Maybe their rate would increase and
