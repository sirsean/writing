Jim Souhan [with another totally inexplicable phrase](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/63205392.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUqCP:iUiacyKUUr):

> Mauer could have prevented the melee. All he had to do was tug his earhole to tell Young that a purpose pitch was headed toward his right knee. That's a new baseball PED -- predictive earhole displacement.

Predictive earhole displacement? Look, Souhan, I realize that you're completely incompetent at this point and I shouldn't go out of my way to point it out any more. It's just kind of sad to see you phoning it in all the time.

But you _do_ realize a) that you accused Mauer of "using PEDs," and b) the only thing saving you from being called out on it is that "predictive earhole displacement" is the stupidest thing anyone's ever heard.
