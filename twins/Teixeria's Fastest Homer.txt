[From Buster Olney](http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4548080&name=olney_buster&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines):

> Mark Teixeira's home run was the fastest of the year, quite literally. More from Mr. Ebaugh: "Tex's walk-off homer in the 11th was a laser down the left-field line that nearly left a dent in the wall. According to our friends at hittrackeronline.com, Teixeira's home run left the bat at a blazing 110 mph and left the ballpark in 2.88 seconds. That is by far the quickest that any home run has left the park this season."

> The full top 5, from Hit Tracker's Greg Rybarczyk:

> 1. Teixeira, 2.88 seconds, Oct. 9, 11th inning
> 2. B.J. Upton, 3.01 seconds, April 16, fourth inning
> 3. Justin Morneau, 3.03 seconds, May 26, fifth inning
> 4. Robinson Cano, 3.05 seconds, May 21, second inning
> 5 (tie). Travis Hafner, 3.06 seconds, June 16, ninth inning
> 5 (tie). Willy Aybar, 3.06 seconds, June 25, second inning

The fact that these numbers exist is, frankly, awesome.

I remember that Morneau blast, and it really did get out of the park in a hurry.

But the fact that the fastest home run of the season, far and away, was an extra inning walkoff shot in the playoffs? Against the Twins? A bit of a dagger, you know?

Still.
