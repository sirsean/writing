We have an update on one of the Twins' bright new prospects, Miguel Angel Sano/Jean, in the form of some [sour grapes from Pittsburgh](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10078/1044060-63.stm). Dejan Kovacevic, the talented Pirates beat writer, says the early indications "sure sound liek a match for all those long-stared, lofty expectations," and the article is filled with thinly veiled criticism of the Pittsburgh front office for falling short in its efforts to sign Sano/Jean.

> On Thursday, before the Pirates and Twins played a Grapefruit League game at adjacent Hammond Stadium, Sano stood out in stature and talent in his group of rookie-level minor leaguers: He looked smooth and natural in all facets, and he homered deep to left in his batting practice.

That's exactly what I had hoped to hear. Often, these hot shot Dominican prospects are considered "raw," and their futures are all based on their "projectable" bodies; unlike Carlos Gomez, it's possible that Sano/Jean may not have as long a road to "learning the game." And that'd be a big bonus.

But perhaps the most interesting part of the article is the quotes from Sano/Jean himself.

> Earlier in the week, Sano told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that he chose the Twins because of star players Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau.

> "I want to be able to play with them," Sano said through an interpreter.

If you needed another reason for the Twins to do whatever they can to sign Mauer, you've got it. Sure, the big stars in the middle of the lineup are key to winning games, and marketing the franchise, and drawing fans to the stadium. But they _also_ are instrumental in attracting high upside talent to the organization. 

> Regarding his bonus, the highest ever for a Latin American position player: "Right now, I really don't look at money. I let my mom worry about that. In two or three years, when I get to Major League Baseball, I'll start thinking about it."

That's right. The money was less important to him than the chance to be on the field with Mauer and Morneau.

If Mauer signs a long term contract, I think we can expect to see some more prospects like Sano/Jean to find their way, moth-like, to the bright lights put off by these stars.
