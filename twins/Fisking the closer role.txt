Want to have some fun? Ed Price over at Fanhouse just "penned"* an article about the Twins' bullpen situation, [defending Gardenhire](http://mlb.fanhouse.com/2010/04/22/criticism-of-gardenhire-twins-is-undeserved-uninformed/) for selecting Rauch as the closer instead of going with a closer-by-committee situation. It's not clear if Price actually thinks Rauch was the best option; instead, his article is about how [Joe Sheehan doesn't know shit about baseball because he never wore a jock](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1168398/index.htm). I love these.

_* Should it really be "penned" these days? Maybe it should be "keyboarded" or something? I mean, when was the last time you saw someone write more than a couple sentences with an actual pen?_

**In an article in the April 19 issue of Sports Illustrated, Joe Sheehan criticizes the Twins and manager Ron Gardenhire for naming Jon Rauch the team's closer after the season-ending injury to Joe Nathan.**

I suppose that since Price apparently reads Sports Illustrated on paper -- implied by the fact that he knows the date of the issue -- I think he may have actually written this article with a pen. Which should say a lot about the direction he'll go with his article.

**Sheehan writes that Gardenhire decided to go with a single closer "because a statistic -- the save -- is driving the process."**

Okay, so we know Price uses a pen to write, which means he's an old guy who hates stats. But it's not just _stats_ he hates, but rather _your_ stats. Get ready for a defense of the "save" as a statistic, and of managers who work to maximize the number of saves an individual player gets. After all, it's tradition, and those never change. When was there ever a time when baseball managers didn't save their best pitcher for the last inning? Baseball must have really sucked back then, if it ever happened.

**Which shows that Sheehan doesn't understand Gardenhire, or baseball players, or the game.**

Yup. Classic opening salvo.

**Sheehan, who has also written for Baseball Prospectus, knows how to analyze baseball statistics. But the game isn't played by computer printouts, it's played by players.**

Well, we've reached the crux of the argument, I think. Sheehan just doesn't understand that baseball is _real_. All this time he was mistaken, thinking that the thing to which he'd dedicated his life was just a meaningless simulation, like in that Star Trek episode.

No, I don't remember which Star Trek episode. Weren't they all pretty much like that?

**Writes Sheehan:**

> **No matter how strong Rauch has looked so far, Minnesota's depth and breadth of skills cry out for a bullpen built around something more substantial than the save rule.**

To recap: Sheehan says Gardenhire should utilize his bullpen in a way that maximizes the talent of the players he has.

**But Gardenhire isn't building his bullpen around the save rule. He's building it around his players.**

To recap: Price says Gardenhire is utilizing his bullpen in a way that maximizes the talent of the players he has.

**What Sheehan doesn't understand is that managers manage people. And a manager's No. 1 task is to put his players in the proper situations -- in games and in their frames of mind -- to succeed.**

And Price knows the secret of baseball: that there's one and _only one_ way to manage people. Anything a manager does that's different from what Tony LaRussa does is stupid and wrong. That's why John McGraw was such a fucking dipshit of a manager: he didn't know the secret, magical way to manage people.

**Statistics represent what the players have done; the players do not simply perform to predetermined statistics, like Strat-o-matic cards.**

Let me try to explain this, so we can all understand where Price is coming from.

Good baseball players get a hit 30% of the time or so. Great pitchers get outs via a strikeout about 30% of the time. There are other such "numbers," many of them, which you can use to measure what the players have done. People used to invent these numbers: once upon a time, batting average was invented, and it was good. Decades later, the "save" itself was invented, and that was good too.

Then everyone pretty much realized that the state of baseball knowledge had reached its Platonic ideal, and that any attempt, by anyone, ever, to come up with a new or different way of understanding the game is _a fucking asshole who wants to rape your children and burn effigies of your favorite childhood ballplayers_. I'm pretty sure these are indisputable facts of history.

So what Price is trying to say is that Sheehan thinks baseball is not real, that it's no different from Strat-O-Matic, which is a board game that simulates real baseball by playing with cards and dice and such. So you can pretend to be the manager by making decisions like "the next hitter is a lefty who mashes right handed pitchers, and my pitcher is right handed ... should I bring in a lefty to face this guy?" You know, stuff that _real_ baseball managers never have to think about.

Because ...

**And players are people.**

That's right. Because players are people. And that means Dennys Reyes is just as good at retiring Albert Pujols as he is at retiring Ryan Howard.

**More than 10 years ago, when I was covering the Arizona Diamondbacks, I asked closer Gregg Olson about a theory I had. What if a team designated an "ace reliever" instead of a closer, and used him when the situation was most crucial -- maybe in the ninth, as a closer would, but maybe with men on in the eighth, or with the heart of the order up in the seventh?**

That's quite an interesting theory you had. You must feel pretty good about yourself, because that's pretty much the same theory that all the smartest baseball minds I know of came up with. But if you're going to appeal to some authority on the subject of bullpen management, maybe you should talk to a smart baseball mind, like Bill James or Joe Posnanski, or Rob Neyer or Joe Sheehan. No, on second thought, it's better to ask Gregg Olson. After all, those eggheads never got paid to scratch themselves in a filthy dugout, so what the fuck do they know?

Gregg Olson, on the other hand, racked up 217 saves over his 14 year career. I think that proves a) that he's thought deeply about the best way to manage a bullpen, b) that he's a pretty bright guy in geneneral, and c) that he's bound to be pretty open-minded about shaking up the status quo that earned him $12.75M because he had reasonably good save totals.

**Olson told me it wouldn't work because relievers want to know their roles. Because of the way bullpens have evolved, players expect to be a closer, or the eighth-inning pitcher, or the seventh-inning pitcher, or the long man, or the lefty specialist.**

Surprisingly, despite the conflict of interest, Olson sided with the status quo that makes closers disproportionately more money than their equally good setup-man counterparts. Talking to unbiased sources and paraphrasing them in such a way that they precisely back up the argument that you were trying to make from the beginning ... this is what you learn in Journalism School. You'd know that if you could find the way out of your mom's basement, blogging _nerd_.

**Baseball people say that relievers want to know it's their turn even before the phone rings. If they are handed a certain role, they know how and when to prepare to pitch.**

Because your warmup pitches don't work if you're told to warm up, and you didn't already _know_ you were going to have to warm up.

**(And no matter what the numbers say, there is something different about the last three outs that some guys can handle and some can't.)**

And no matter what your gut says, outs in the 7th inning _can_ be higher leverage than the outs in the 9th inning. I mean, I just felt like I should point that out, since we're just saying things that you're not allowed to disagree with, as if it proves some sort of point.

**Now perhaps relievers' expectations have been created by Tony La Russa and his followers using pitchers in accordance with the save rule. But it's how relievers have been used for decades, and players are used to it.**

Sure, things changed before, and we think they changed for the better. Therefore, future changes cannot also be for the better.

**So by picking a closer, Gardenhire wasn't managing to the save rule. He was managing his players, setting up his reliever usage so the pitchers knew what they would be asked to do and could prepare for it.**

If we're assigning motive to Gardy, to whom you did not speak and did not quote, then why don't we bother wondering why he selected the guy with the most career saves? I mean, it seems like maybe he might have been thinking about the number of saves.

**Perhaps the most annoying thing about the column: It was titled "Inside Baseball."**

Are you sure? Because I clicked on it, and it said the title was "Closing Ranks," which is much cleverer and more title-ish.

**It was written by someone who doesn't talk to baseball people and is anything but "inside" the game.**

And ... the one "baseball person" you talked to for this article was a decent-but-not-great closer who retired 9 years ago, you talked to him "over ten years ago," and you didn't even directly quote him. So, you know, that's a pretty high horse you're on right now.
