Bad news, everyone!

[Joe Nathan played catch with Rick Anderson this morning](http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/88759362.html), to determine if he could pitch through his injury and get by without having Tommy John surgery. His conclusion? **No.**

> "Didn’t go like we hoped," Nathan said. "We knew it was a long shot, but what this did do is clear my head. Definitely was no gray area. Definitely was on the black side, where it didn’t go as well as we like, and we know now we’re going to have to go in and get some surgery done, get this thing fixed up."

Joe Christensen watched the throwing session, and said Nathan was "making some strong throws before it ended," and that he couldn't tell whether it had gone badly.

> "As we kept throwing, it became clear that it was getting harder and harder to play catch," Nathan said. "It became clear that it didn’t feel great. This was going to be an easy answer for me to know I wouldn’t be able to pitch without getting this thing taken care of."

I'm glad there's no gray area for him in this, and that it was such an easy decision. This is not something Nathan should be second-guessed about all summer, every time a lesser reliever struggles in the 9th inning. I think we all knew this had to be done, and this just makes it official.

Given that the estimated recovery time is 12 months, we now await the news as to when he's having the surgery; Nathan himself said "as soon as possible," and hopefully he's going by his own definition of the words "soon" and "possible," rather than the Twins' version which would undoubtedly have him wait until November to have the surgery.
