While I wait to be invited to join the BBWAA, my Hall of Fame vote doesn't actually count. But I think it's still worth putting a ballot together, and maybe get some sort of discussion going about it. If, that is, anyone out there hasn't already been overwhelmed by other, better bloggers posting their own ballots.

So here's the way I'm going to do this. As I go down the list of guys (in alphabetical order), any time I see one of them that I think has anything _close_ to a case, I'm going to talk through what I see as his case, and then make a verdict. At the end, I'll have my ballot. Here goes!

# Roberto Alomar

Of course, the first thing on [his B-R page](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/alomaro01.shtml) that stands out is that he is the "Brother of Sandy Alomar and Son of Sandy Alomar." Of course they're different Sandy Alomars, but if you didn't already know that, wouldn't that be a little confusing? And perhaps tell you something false (yet somehow intriguing) about the Alomar family's construction?

Anyhow, Roberto was an All Star in 12 consecutive years, and won the Gold Glove 10 times (a record for 2B). He finished in the top 6 of the MVP voting 6 times (topping out at #3). He started his career young and had some less-than-productive seasons, but got good at age 23, jumping his OPS+ up to 115 that year, and improving from there. He had a 10 year peak (pretty long) during which he was fairly consistent, produced a 127 OPS+ while winning 9 Gold Gloves at 2B. He led the league in runs scored in 1999, with 138; he scored 100+ runs 6 times. He was a career .300 hitter (I don't care too much about batting average, but .300 over a career remains impressive ... and if you couple it with plate discipline you've got yourself a great player); he posted a .400+ OBP 5 times, and ended with a career .371 OBP.

Memory-wise ... Alomar was one of the players I modeled myself after as a child. I was, when I was younger, a good-glove second baseman and prided myself on hitting line drives just like I thought Alomar did every time. I don't think that really counts for anything, but it doesn't exactly hurt.

These, to me, are the numbers of a Hall of Famer: it's really hard to find guys that productive with the bat who simultaneously provide elite defense at a premier position. Most of the case against him seems to be off the field stuff. He spit on an umpire, and there was some sort of incident with a girlfriend in which he allegedly had HIV but lied to her about it so she'd have sex with him ... there aren't many details about it and she dropped her $15M lawsuit. Frankly, I don't care about this stuff too much -- there are already plenty of assholes in the Hall of Fame, and it seems wrong to start keeping them out without pruning the ranks of former great baseball players with reprehensible personal lives (and I don't think anybody wants to do that). So I'm going to go ahead and say Alomar's in.

# Harold Baines

Baines played primary RF in his early years, before switching to DH and sticking there -- the vast majority of his games are at DH. I think that's a good place to start here, given that so much of Alomar's value came because of both his stellar defense _and_ his position. Playing at offense-first positions, Baines never hit 30 HRs; he hit as many as 25 just thrice. In 22 seasons, he had 100 RBIs just three times, and never scored 100 runs. His .356 OBP shows some reasonable plate discipline, but he posted a .400+ OBP just once.

We're talking about a guy who finished with a good (not great) 120 OPS+ for his career; never posted big HR, RBI, or R totals in a given season despite playing on the wrong side of the defensive spectrum; played 22 seasons, but didn't play in the field after he turned 28 years old; and despite his longevity quit before he could make it to the magic 3000 hits ... which would have been his only chance to have a case. I just don't think Baines was a good enough baseball player to be in the Hall of Fame.

# Bert Blyleven

Everyone knows about Blyleven already. I'm not in the mood, right now, to toss my voice into the cacophonous winds of blogosphere merely to be drowned out and lost. Suffice it to say that you should just read Posnanski's [latest case for Bert](http://joeposnanski.com/JoeBlog/2009/12/28/daily-blyleven-12-28/), which of course does assume that you've already heard all the basic arguments. Blyleven's not even worth talking about at this point. He's in.
