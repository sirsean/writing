> Is there a better way in baseball? Well, to be honest, it doesn’t matter now: The way they do things is unsustainable. There are too many camera angles. Baseball has had a 100-year-fight against illegitimacy — whether it’s gambling, racism, steroids or the disparity of big market and small. Bad calls are a threat too. Baseball has to do something. Maybe it’s a challenge system. Maybe it’s an eye in the booth like in college football. Whatever, something has to give. And something will, probably as soon as this off-season. There is too much money and interest and technology around today to allow an umpire to call a fair ball foul in the playoffs.

Could this be the second year in a row that the Minnesota Twins get fucked by an old rule that nobody really thought through and tried to get right, and because of it, they change the rule?

If so, I can only assume that for the second year in a row, the Twins become the first beneficiary of the new rule, next year.

See, silver lining!
