With all this talk about the 2011 season, and the complaints about the offseason spending that makes me wonder if I was imagining the packed Target Field every day in 2010, I feel like things are getting a little too short-sighted and whiny.

Keith Law's [organizational rankings](http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/insider/news/story?page=2011MLBOrgRanks) and [top 100 prospect lists](http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/insider/columns/story?columnist=law_keith&page=LawTop100ProspectsIndex) just came out this week, so let's take a quick glance at the top guys in the Twins' system and let a few dreams carry us closer to Spring Training.

Law gives the Twins the 7th-best system in the majors; frankly, that's higher than I assumed they'd be ranked given what has seemed like a paucity of impact players at the upper and middle levels of the system. But that may have just been a multi-year blip, and the farm system seems to be re-filling.

> A sneaky-good system, it's not loaded with big names but boasts a few impact guys and a ton of depth. This is more than just the Twins' usual assortment of strike-throwing fourth starters and speedy outfielders, a testament to good drafting and some major investments in the international arena, where they've been as aggressive as any club.

He puts five Twins prospects in his Top 100: Aaron Hicks, Miguel Angel Sano/Jean, Kyle Gibson, Ben Revere, and Oswaldo Arcia.

## 10: Aaron Hicks

A 21 year old switch-hitting outfielder, the Twins have been excited about him since they drafted him out of high school, but have been moving him along slowly.

> Hicks took a step forward in 2010 by converting his tools into baseball performance. He's a true five-tool player, with an 80 arm in the outfield, above-average speed, future plus power and excellent bat speed. He's much smoother hitting right-handed, with better balance and weight transfer, and it showed this year in his platoon split, as he hit just .248/.383/.339 against right-handers even though he was repeating the level.

> His plate discipline continues to improve, and there's plenty of leverage in there for power when he fills out, but the inability to hit right-handed pitching is a major concern that will have to be addressed, perhaps by having him give up switch-hitting if it doesn't improve. On tools alone, Hicks is a top-5 prospect in the game, and I still expect him to become a star, but there's some risk here and I can understand why the Twins are taking it a little slow with him.

## 29: Miguel Angel Sano/Jean

I'm extremely excited about this guy, despite the continued questions about how old he really is. You'll recall he was allegedly 16, though his age was unverifiable, and that scared off many teams from bidding on him. The Twins flashed some cash and won the bidding, in a move that seems like it may have started an intriguing trend (given the Nishioka signing).

> Sano won't turn 18 until May, but his hitting tools would make him a top-five pick if he were just coming out of an American high school, with consideration for the top overall spot. He's a natural hitter, with very good balance and plus bat speed, and there will be power not too far down the road because he gets great leverage from his lower half.

> He has started to fill out quickly and is big enough that there's zero chance he remains at shortstop. And despite a 70 or better arm, there's a rapidly declining chance he sticks at third base, because he easily could end up at 240 pounds or more by the time he's in his mid-20s. He is a below-average runner but is agile enough that he'll work out somewhere in the field, perhaps right field because of his arm strength, and his bat will profile anywhere he plays, with average and potentially big-time power.

## 32: Kyle Gibson

Gibson had a fracture in his forearm in college that hurt his draft status; he was supposed to be a top-10, maybe top-5, draft pick but slipped all the way to the Twins. The injury was supposedly not caused by pitching, didn't indicate a problem with his delivery, and the doctors claimed he should fully recover. That appears to have happened, because Gibson has been dynamite on the mound and is close to major-league ready.

> Gibson is not the exciting top-of-the-rotation type of arm that most pitchers this high on the list represent, but he is extremely high-probability and could pitch above the level of his stuff because of his command and feel. He will show three solid-average pitches most nights and pounds the strike zone with all three. His fastball tops out at 94 mph or so, but his slider flashes above average and he can get ground balls with both pitches, keeping the ball out of the air on 57 percent of balls he allowed in play in 2010.

> Gibson is tall and still looks like he could pack some weight on his shoulders, perhaps adding a mile an hour or two to the fastball, and his arm action is easy and repeatable, which probably explains a lot of his above-average command and control. He is a midrotation starter with a No. 2 ceiling but is so close to major league-ready that he should get the call in 2011 and could have an effect down the stretch.

## 71: Ben Revere

After seeing him "play," I'm a little down on Revere. His upside seems to me like it's a poor-man's Juan Pierre. So if the Twins can find some team that's into that, I'd love to see what they could get in a trade for Revere, who has the pedigree of a top prospect.

> Revere is a major league-ready center fielder with a chance to hit for average and add value through baserunning, despite having two below-average tools.

> Revere is a 70-80 runner who covers a ton of ground in center through his speed, and his reads have improved substantially over the three-plus years he's been in the Twins' organization. He still has a well below-average arm that will probably require middle infielders to head into short center for cutoff throws, but the added range Revere provides should compensate. At the plate, Revere's swing is as short as it gets, slappy and flat, and the way he meets the ball out front means he won't have power, but he has good hand-eye coordination and will make enough contact to have value as a hitter.

> I don't see Revere as a star, but that kind of defense makes him a valuable regular.

## 74: Oswaldo Arcia

A 19 year old outfielder, I hadn't heard of this guy until early in the 2010 season when he was absolutely destroying every pitch he saw. Seriously, he batted .375/.424/.672 in 2010, with 21 doubles, 7 triples, and 14 homers in just 283 plate appearances. He's been splitting his time between CF and RF, and hasn't made an error in two years. Obviously he's a long way away, but if he does in 2011 what he did in 2010, he'll be one of the top prospects in the game and, along with Aaron Hicks, will give the Twins a future outfield to drool over.

> Talk about a guy coming out of nowhere. Arcia screwed up one of his knees in an on-field collision and missed a chunk of the 2009 season, but tore apart the Appalachian League this past year and has jumped onto the pro scouting radar.

> Arcia has a very classic left-handed swing and nearly mimics it from the right side, although he did most of his damage (.398/.455/.760) hitting left-handed. The raw power is enormous, again better left-handed, where it's to all fields. He's a 55-60 runner who won the Twins over by improving his conditioning while rehabbing the knee, and he has a plus arm to let him stay in right field once he outgrows center.

> The Twins have developed a lot of players in recent years, but not many with this kind of raw power and overall ceiling.

---

And that's the end of our trip through the cream of the farm's crop. I am a little surprised that Tsuyoshi Nishioka didn't make the cut -- I wonder if that's because Law doesn't consider him a prospect since he's never played in the minor leagues or because he's not nearly as young as the other guys, or if it's because he is considered a prospect and wouldn't be in Law's top 100.

I would think Nishioka would be ranked somewhere between Gibson and Revere if he were to be included in the list, which leaves the Twins in a pretty strong position.

Sometimes it's fun to eagerly await the future, rather than be bogged down by the crushing reality of the present. Who knows what the team will look like when Sano/Jean, Hicks, and Arcia ascend -- but if a few things break right and their development continues as we hope it will, it could restock the Twins' core of stars just in time.

And it's worth pointing out that all of these guys are pretty new to the system -- if the front office can continue to add potential stars to the minor leagues at the same rate they have been for the last couple of years, through drafting and (especially) international signings, then the Twins will continue to be mentioned as one of the models of how an organization should be run.
