I don't think I've actually included it in a blog post, but I've wanted to see Delmon batting third for a while now; he's been the Twins' best hitter for at least a month, he's just about the only guy on the team consistently hitting with runners on base, he's a right handed bat that'd split Mauer/Morneau up very nicely, and he's close to a good enough hitter that he can carry the 3 spot and push Mauer to the 2 spot where he belongs. I've mentioned this in the comments, and verbally while watching games. But it wasn't happening: instead, Delmon kept falling further and further down in the order, regularly batting 8th while everyone ahead of him slumped.

Then, yesterday, while I was getting ready to head off to Wrigley Field and miss the Twins game, I saw this:

> Gardy on Delmon hitting third - "You guys all want him up there anyways. Or your bloggers do." #Twins  
> --[@PMac21](http://twitter.com/PMac21/status/17424011268)

Of course, the blogosphere is going to blow up just a little bit if Gardy attributes a move he made to what bloggers are writing. Personally, I doubt Gardy reads many blogs. But I'm guessing there are people in the organization who do read blogs, and maybe they relay some highlights* to Gardy from time to time.

_* I suppose that'd be a good thing. I don't believe bloggers consistently know what they're talking about, but I also don't believe they are, as a group, utterly bereft of good ideas. I mean, I hope not. This is a blog, after al._

In a way, the move worked: Delmon drove in a run. In another way, it didn't work: he only went 1-4 on the day. In yet another, more accurate way, it doesn't matter: it's only one game. Regardless, when Mauer returns to the lineup, Gardy will probably slide him right back into his rightful spot, batting third. After all, we're not paying Mauer $23M per year to get on base and let the big hitters drive him in! We're paying for homers! Mauer bats third!

In the hope that Gardy is still listening, I have a few things to say:

- Cuddyer seems to do better when you don't lean on him as the 4th or 5th hitter in the lineup
- Delmon should keep batting third
- Mauer is a natural-born 2-hitter (and is hitting .320/.384/.532 in his career when batting second)
- You can't really keep running Blacburn* out there every five days unless something changes (like, for example, he learns how to be a pitcher)
- When Mauer sits out, you move everyone around in the lineup (because it's dumb to have Butera bat third); but when anybody else sits, you say you don't want to screw up everyone else's spot in the order (somehow it's not dumb to have Tolbert bat second). It can't be both!

_* Blacburn. I picked this up from Twitter, and I like it. If you're striking batters out at a historically-low rate, you don't get to have a K in your name._

Anybody else have suggestions for Gardy?
