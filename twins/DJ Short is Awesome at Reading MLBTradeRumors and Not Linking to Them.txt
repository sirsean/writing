DJ Short over at Circling the Bases has been doing a _great job_ this weekend of reading MLBTradeRumors and re-posting their news, linking to the same sources as MLBTradeRumors but _not_ to the original MLBTradeRumors articles. Basically every one of DJ Short's articles follow this form. Even better, he adds no relevant analysis of any of the news.

I'm glad that Craig Calcaterra is moving over there full-time soon, as he's one of the best in the business. Once Calcaterra's move is completed, it'd be nice if DJ Short could be let go.

I mean, we can all read MLBTradeRumors for ourselves, right?
