> Another thing worth mentioning: Zack Greinke signed a four-year $38 million extension with the Kansas City Royals before the 2009 season. That will keep him from being a free agent after the 2010 season -- the Royals have him under control through the 2012 season, when he will make $13.5 million per year. But, seriously, how much money could Greinke have made on the open market after his ridiculously great 2009 season? If you assume that Greinke will have a good season in 2010 -- and I think that's a fair assumption -- he would have hit the open market as a 26-year-old pitcher with incredible stuff who had one of the more remarkable pitching seasons in memory.

> It sounds off-key to spend a lot of time celebrating a player who did, after all, sign for $38 million. But Greinke left tens of millions of dollars on the table in order to stay with the team that stuck with him through hard times.

It's disingenuous to say that Greinke "left tens of millions of dollars on the table" here, because a lot of people around him said that his remarkable 2009 season may have been related to the newfound security he felt because of that guaranteed money.

Without that $38M contract, Greinke may never have done this in 2009, and thus wouldn't have been theoretically in position for a hypothetical $150M+ mega-deal after 2010.

And if Greinke starts thinking along those lines now, he may not come close to repeating 2009 -- I don't want to be too crass about this, but he has something of a history of, shall we say, issues of the head.
