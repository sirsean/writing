Allow me to let you in on a little secret. The secret to pitching, as it were.

The correct way to pitch is as follows:

- Throw fastballs inside the strike zone
- Don't ever walk anyone
- Rely on your defense to get outs
- Pitch to the score: the bigger your lead, the meatier your pitches

If you do those things, you're a great pitcher. That's why, when I saw Jarrod Washburn dominate in Seattle and then implode in Detroit, despite identical peripheral numbers, I knew he was the sort of guy I wanted on my team. His success is totally reliant on his teammates, and that makes him a team player.

Of course, my pursuit of Washburn came up empty; but not to worry, there's an even more perfect pitcher who needs a contract, and he happened to be right under my nose!

Nick Blackburn is exactly that sort of pitcher. He's the _mold_ of that perfect pitcher. He has a sinking fastball that I'm told generates oodles of ground balls conveniently straight at our defenders -- that's what sinking fastballs do, right? He doesn't walk people or strike them out, and does a great job of keeping his teammates engaged in the game by making them chase down balls in play for every batter.

Nobody is better at pitching to the score than Blackburn. For example, in 2008 we played Game 163 against the White Sox, and Blackburn pitched great. The offense wasn't scoring any runs, so he needed to excel to keep it close. And he did. The only blemish was a home run to Jim Thome, which I can't fault him for ... after all, if you're serving up nothing but meaty fastballs to a great hitter like Thome, eventually he'll get you. Not Nicky's fault! Another example I like is the game against the Athletics in July of 2009: the offense scored 12 runs in the first 3 innings, which left Blackie plenty of wiggle room. Like any good pitcher, he went right after the opposing pitchers with thigh-high "sinkers," and reverted to innings-eater mode. That he was knocked out after completing only 5 innings, or that he gave up 7 runs, or that we ended up losing the game 14-13 are not important. The important thing is that he pitched to the score, which is exactly what I want him doing. It's what I want all our pitchers to do.

So that's why I was so excited to offer Blackburn a contract. Some people accused me of making a bad deal, since I just guaranteed him money that I didn't need to, and I didn't get any extra years of team control out of it. I mean, sure, I _could_ have gone year-to-year with Blackburn throughout his arbitration years, but if there's anything I know about the arbitration process it's that those arbiters really value guys who can eat up 200 innings per year and post consistent ERAs and have a .500 record. If I went year-to-year with him, we'd be looking at huge salaries, well over $10M per season. So I saved a ton of money. 

And besides, why would I want to guarantee him any more years beyond his four year deal? He'll be over 30 by then, and probably won't be any good any more.
