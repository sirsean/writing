Brendan Harris sat in a sterile hotel room with the lights off, staring at the window as a heavy rain battered it, splashing against the clear glass with a violence that matched what he felt in his heart. The infielder knew he'd run out of rope, and that his baseball career was as good as over. He was up for arbitration, with the Twins; he knew he was the worst player on their team, that his only value was his "versatility," which is a euphemism for "not good at any position," and the Twins also had Nick "Mr Versatility" Punto _and_ Matt "Nick Punto 2" Tolbert, who could each hit about as well as Harris but had the dual advantages of being able to field slightly better and, perhaps more importantly, look better doing it.

Harris knew that whenever a ground ball bounced in his direction, he looked like he squirted a little in his shorts and then barely made the play (in fact, he often failed to make the play ... do you have any idea how difficult it is to field a grounder with diarrhea streaming down the back of your thigh?). And he knew Gardenhire hated him. And he knew his agent sucked.

He looked down at his cell phone, in his hand. He was waiting for a call from his agent, who was supposed to be negotiating with Bill Smith at the moment. What was taking so long? It couldn't be good that it was taking so long. Harris hurled his phone across the room, knocking over a lamp and bouncing harmlessly against the wall.

I had my feet up on my desk, my hands behind my head, reclining back in my expensive and luxurious chair, thinking to myself that it's great to be the general manager of a baseball team ... especially one with a big enough payroll that a $2000 desk chair can slip through the cracks of the budget. Best decision my ass ever made.

On my desk was my schedule for the day, and I didn't really feel like looking at it. If today was like most days, the schedule only served to remind me when I'm supposed to eat, when I'm supposed to golf, and when I'm supposed to call my mother so she can tell me how great I am. Surely, today's just like most days, so there's no need to check the schedule. Instead, I gazed out the window overlooking Target Field, surrounded by the Minneapolis skyline. It's a nice view.

I started to wonder what time it was and how long until my next hot dog, when there was a businesslike knock on the door and it popped open.

**Stacy:** Mr Smith? Your 11 o'clock is here.  
**Great Bill Smith:** What? What 11 o'clock?  
**Stacy:** Brendan Harris's agent. It's on your schedule.  
**Great Bill Smith:** _Glancing down at the schedule to confirm that she's right._ Oh. Well, thank you Bridget. Send him in.  

Stacy stepped outside, opening the door for Harris's agent and shutting it behind him.

The agent's suit was slightly disheveled, and his tie wasn't fastened very tightly. He looked nervous. I felt bad about it.

**Great Bill Smith:** Hey, have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.  
**Agent:** Thanks. _Sits down, leaning forward._  
**Great Bill Smith:** So, what do we have to talk about?  
**Agent:** Brendan Harris, and his contract situation.  
**Great Bill Smith:** What contract situation? He's arbitration-eligible, and we offered arbitration.  
**Agent:** Brendan doesn't want to go to arbitration ... can we negotiate a contract instead?  

At this, I chuckled. I _love_ negotiating contracts. I'm great at it, everybody says so. I cracked the knuckles on my stubby hands and leaned forward, looking forward to the negotiations.

**Great Bill Smith:** Oh, yes. Let's negotiate.  
**Agent:** Well, Harris had a good season last year, and he's versatile. He can play all the infield positions.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Versatility is important. The two best players on the team are versatile.  
**Agent:** Exactly! The more the better, right?  
**Great Bill Smith:** That's what I always say! _Popping a handful of bite-size Snicker bars into his mouth_  
**Agent:** So Harris adds to one of the team's strengths with his versatility, but he also helps out one of its weaknesses: he bats right handed.  
**Great Bill Smith:** That's true, right handed hitters are important. People keep telling me that, anyway. I always thought left handed hitters were better. One of those "grass is always greener" things, I guess.  
**Agent:** Well, um, I suppose so. But since the grass is greener, you'll want a good right handed hitter. And those'll cost you a few million.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Where can I get a good right handed hitter for only a few million?  
**Agent:** Brendan Harris would be willing to play for only a few million.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Of course! Why didn't I think of that?  
**Agent:** You did think of it.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Of course I did? Why did I ever let you question me? Let's see, Harris is a good hitter who'll play for only a few million?  
**Agent:** Yes.  
**Great Bill Smith:** I don't think I have enough in the budget for a few million this year. He'll have to come down a bit.  
**Agent:** Um, what about deferred money?  
**Great Bill Smith:** No. We don't defer money.  
**Agent:** Harris will take a pay cut this year if you give him a second year on the contract.  
**Great Bill Smith:** So I get to pay him less this year, _and_ I get to keep control of him for next year?  
**Agent:** Well, yes.  
**Great Bill Smith:** What kind of a pay cut?  
**Agent:** $1.5M this year, $2M next year?  
**Great Bill Smith:** _Leaps from his chair, much more nimbly than you'd expect_ Are you out of your mind? That's ludicrous! Unacceptable!  
**Agent:** _Stunned_ Uhh, what? What'd be more reasonable?  
**Great Bill Smith:** $1.4M this year, $1.7M next year.  
**Agent:** $1.45M, $1.75M?  
**Great Bill Smith:** Fine.  
**Agent:** And incentives based on plate appearances.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Yeah, yeah. Deal.  

I had to get this deal done quickly; according to my schedule I have another meeting starting _right now_, with a walleye sandwich. I smacked the intercom button.

**Great Bill Smith:** Suzie! Where's my lunch?  
**Stacy:** I'll bring it right in, Mr Smith.  

She stepped in with a plate filled with a sandwich. I lit into it eagerly, devouring it with gusto. The agent stared at me with some sort of look on his face ... I'd have noticed what sort of look if I could get a clear view of him, but there was a fish in front of my face, blocking my view.

**Great Bill Smith:** It's a done deal. We'll write up the papers, and Harris can sign them. Now get the hell out of here before I change my mind!  

The agent nodded and scurried out of my office. He knows who's boss.

I finished up my sandwich and licked my fingers. I looked back out the window, pleased with myself. I am a great negotiator.

Brendan Harris heard a phone ring. His phone. He jerked his head toward the sound, looking for it. He slowly got up and went rummaging for it among the remaining pieces of the lamp it'd struck. He found it in time, and smashed the green button that means "answer the call."

**Harris:** Hello?  
**Agent:** Brendan, baby! It's your agent!  
**Harris:** Yeah, yeah.  
**Agent:** I've got some good news for you!  
**Harris:** What?  
**Agent:** How would you like a contract with the Twins?  
**Harris:** You got me a contract?  
**Agent:** Two years. $3.2M, plus incentives.  
**Harris:** What?!?! How did you pull that off?  
**Agent:** The Twins really value your versatility, and your right handed bat. I had to do a bit of negotiating with Bill Smith, but it worked out, eh?  
**Harris:** I guess it did!  
**Agent:** You happy, baby?  
**Harris:** Yeah ... I am. Thanks!  

Harris dropped the phone and went back to the window. He couldn't believe his luck. He thought the Twins were going to cut him; at best, he'd be a bench player on a one year deal. But they went multiple years? They were making a real investment in him! Harris had never been happier.

He saw his reflection in the glass of the window. He was scowling.
