Every baseball man knows that it's vital to have veterans in the pitching staff. If you don't have a veteran in there, who knows what'd happen? They eat innings, and they're predictable, and they know all the unwritten rules, and they cost a lot so you know they're good, and they invariably pass along good habits to your young pitchers. There simply isn't a bad thing to say about having veterans in your pitching staff.

And having recently witness the great work done by Ramon Ortiz, Sidney Ponson, and Livan Hernandez, I wanted to repeat that success. Sure, I have Pavano, but my friends in New York keep telling me that he's an unreliable douche bag who only wants to steal my money and sleep with my sister. I don't know why I signed him, anyway. But now that I had him, I realized that where one veteran makes a pitching staff better, surely two veterans would make a pitching staff twice as better!

I'd heard a lot about Jarrod Washburn lately. He dominated the first half of the season, in Seattle. He had a 2.64 ERA with Seattle, which is amazing! He was a Cy Young candidate; I'd love to have one of those on my team. And since Washburn is a lefty, I'd be able to get that irritating Liriano out of the rotation once and for all. Win-win. I'd even spoken to Washburn a few times, and he said he'd love to play for Minnesota; after all, he's from Wisconsin and it'd be oh-so-convenient for him to spend time at home during the week and pop down to Minneapolis every five days to dismantle some hapless offense. It sounded good to me, too.

So, after enjoying a bit of after-lunch lazing about the office, I'd made up my mind to go out and get Washburn. I reached out for the intercom, but was rudely interrupted by my door swinging open abruptly, as doors tend to do when they meet someone in a hurry.

That's when a bespectacled nerd whom I swear I've never seen before burst into my office, announced only by the near-shrieking of his annoying nerd voice, to rain on my parade.

**Nerd:** Don't do it!  
**Great Bill Smith:** What are you doing here? Who are you?  
**Nerd:** Washburn's performance last year in Seattle was an illusion. For the Twins, he'll repeat what he did in Detroit.  
**Great Bill Smith:** How do you know? Washburn is a good guy, and he told me he's ready to go! He had some knee troubles in the second half last year, that's all.  
**Nerd:** In Seattle he played in front of a historically great outfield defense, which turned numerous doubles-to-the-gap into outs. That's why his ERA looked so good.  
**Great Bill Smith:** We have a great defense, too.  
**Nerd:** No, we don't. Especially not in the outfield, where Span is the only guy even theoretically capable of running!  
**Great Bill Smith:** But we have Nick Punto. We have a great defense!  
**Nerd:** Punto's not catching deep line drives to left center.  
**Great Bill Smith:** How dare you!  
**Nerd:** _Looking surprised._ What?  
**Great Bill Smith:** Get out of my office.  
**Nerd:** _Being dragged away by hired goons._ Don't sign Washburn. He'd be our 7th best starter!  

Now that that unpleasant experience was behind me, I sprayed some Febreze into the air that the unkempt nerd had sullied when he barged in, and I made up my mind. I was going to sign Jarrod Washburn.

Now, of course, I don't have Scott Boras's phone number. Why should I? It's not like the Twins have ever been able to afford dealing with him. But I know the secret to getting him on the phone, and you don't even need his number. I sat down on the floor, cross-legged (some people call it Indian-style, but damn it, we're not in Cleveland), closed my eyes, and rubbed my hands together. I muttered Boras's secret incantation, which I obviously can't repeat here. I'd be killed!

Within seconds, the phone rang. I scrambled from my seat on the floor as quickly as I could, and got to the phone on the sixth ring. Not bad!

**Boras:** You called?  
**Great Bill Smith:** Boras?  
**Boras:** Yeah yeah, don't waste my time. What is it?  
**Great Bill Smith:** I'd like to make an offer for Jarrod Washburn.  
**Boras:** Ah, Washburn. Great pitcher. Dealt with some leg issues in the second half last year, but he's ready to dominate again.  
**Great Bill Smith:** I bet he is! How does 1 year, $5M sound?  
**Boras:** _Making gurgling noises, like he's choking with rage._ Do not toy with me, Earthling! Washburn is a great pitcher! You don't seriously think you can get him for such a pittance. This is a grave insult.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Oh? What have other teams offered?  
**Boras:** Obviously I can't give you any specifics. But he's got interest from multiple teams, and the market is setting his value at 3 years, at least $20M. That's what you're going to have to hit to get Washburn.  
**Great Bill Smith:** I can't afford that!  
**Boras:** Well you'll have to find a way. I don't even know if he'd be willing to play for you any more, now that you've insulted him so badly with that offer.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Um, I'll see what I can do.  
**Boras:** _Exasperated sigh._ Sure you will, Bill. _Click_
**Great Bill Smith:** _To a dial tone._ Mr Smith.

Oh, boy. That didn't go well. I want to sign Washburn, but surely I shouldn't have to pay twenty million dollars for him! Could it be that all that talk about Washburn wanting to play for us was just a ploy, to get us to make an offer? Am I being used? Is Washburn even from Wisconsin?

I didn't know what to believe any more.

So I did what I always do when I'm confused and irritable: have a hot dog and a nap! I shut off the light, laid down on the couch, and started absent-mindedly munching on a slightly-cooler-than-lukewarm dog that had been waiting for me on the table beside the couch.

Before I knew it, I awoke with a start. It was twilight outside my office windows, and the bright lights of downtown Minneapolis reflected off the glass. I noticed that there was still half a hot dog stuck in my mouth, which I'd apparently forgotten to remove before falling asleep. I tore it from my mouth and dropped it back onto its place on the table; no time for hot dogs now, I'd made up my mind.

Boras was trying to use me. He wanted me to bid against myself. Well, I'm not falling for that! If I want to overpay a pitcher whose success depends entirely on good defense and better luck, then by God, I'll overpay a pitcher whose success depends entirely on good defense and better luck! And I'd like to see that Scott Boras even _try_ to stop me!

I clutched at the intercom on my desk, fumbling in the dark to find the button that would let me talk into it.

**Great Bill Smith:** Hello? Stacy?  
**Stacy:** Yes, Mr Smith?  
**Great Bill Smith:** Get me Nick Blackburn's agent on the phone.  
**Stacy:** Yes, Mr Smith.

It was time to get down to business.
