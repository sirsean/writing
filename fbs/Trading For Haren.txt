So I've heard a lot of rumblings lately that our rotation hasn't been getting the job done. I don't really know what that's about, since I've talked to the pitchers and each one of them insists that they're trying hard; that's all I ask of any player, and if they're trying hard that means their performance is good enough.

But when Gardy dropped Blackburn out of the rotation and forced me to call up Slama from AAA -- where he so obviously belongs -- I started to think that maybe those rumblings had a shade of truth to them. Gardy knows his baseball.

Roy Oswalt is a pretty good pitcher, and his contract makes him look like a _really_ good pitcher; but my front office people told me that I should focus on Dan Haren. He's just as good as Oswalt, they said, except younger and with a better contract. I decided to look into it.

I delved deep into some advanced "statistics," which is what I'm told all the cool kids are doing these days. One of these statistics is "ERA" -- it's the average of how many earned runs a pitcher gives up every nine innings. Pretty tough to wrap your head around, I admit, but it turns out that Harne's is 4.60; initially I thought that must be pretty good, but I learned that's actually below average.

At that point my head kind of hurt from all the statistical mumbo jumbo, but I figured it'd be better to trade for Haren than not to. After all, it's better to open your mouth and reveal yourself as a fool than to keep quiet and preserve some doubt.

So it was time to call the GM of the Diamonbacks.

**Great Bill Smith:** Nancy, get me Josh Byrnes on the phone!  
**Stacy:** Josh Byrnes? Wh--?  
**Great Bill Smith:** Don't ask questions, I already have my negotiating hat on!  
**Stacy:** Well, okay. I'll connect you right now.  
**Byrnes:** Hello?  
**Great Bill Smith:** Josh, what's happening?  
**Byrnes:** Well, to be honest, it's--  
**Great Bill Smith:** Great, great. That's great to hear. Listen, I've got a proposition for you.  
**Byrnes:** A proposition?  
**Great Bill Smith:** I've heard good things about Dan Haren.  
**Byrnes:** Well sure, Haren's a great pitcher.  
**Great Bill Smith:** But what's this about his ERA this year? He seems pretty average to me.  
**Byrnes:** He's still striking people out. It's just bad luck, probably.  
**Great Bill Smith:** I'm not paying for bad luck! That's gonna drive the price down, you know.  
**Byrnes:** You ... want to trade for Haren?  
**Great Bill Smith:** What do you think we're talking about?!  
**Byrnes:** I'm not exactly sure --  
**Great Bill Smith:** Don't interrupt. Look, I've got this guy Wilson Ramos who everyone says is good, but he plays catcher. I already have a catcher, so I've got to unload this guy. So let's start there, shall we?  
**Byrnes:** Fine, but --  
**Great Bill Smith:** And I know that's not going to be enough. I know it takes more than one prospect to land an ace, and I want an ace. So I'll add another guy, right? How about Aaron Hicks?  
**Byrnes:** I've heard about Hicks, he's pretty good. But I --  
**Great Bill Smith:** Pretty good? He's great! Ambidextrous, too, I hear.  
**Byrnes:** I hadn't heard that.  
**Great Bill Smith:** What, then Hicks isn't good enough for you? How about I add Ben Revere too?  
**Byrnes:** Well that sounds like a deal I'd like to make ... but I don't know if I can make that deal.  

At this point, I was really wondering what was the deal with Byrnes. He didn't seem like he really had his head in this negotiation. But hey, if the other guy isn't paying attention, you can really take him for all he's worth! So onward I plowed, not about to let my adversary's lackadaisical approach to negotiation stop me.

**Great Bill Smith:** Can't make the deal? What, it's not enough? Sure seems like a lot to me!  
**Byrnes:** It's not that, it's just --  
**Great Bill Smith:** What if I also add Joe Benson? Would that be enough?!  
**Byrnes:** That'd be enough for me, but --  
**Great Bill Smith:** Okay, alright then! Okay! So we've got a deal!  
**Byrnes:** I wouldn't --  
**Great Bill Smith:** Would. A deal in principle, we'll call it. I'll pop the champagne, you alert the press, and we'll get this deal done. We can have our assistants hammer out the deal later this afternoon.  
**Byrnes:** Good bye, Bill.  
**Great Bill Smith:** Great doing business with you, Josh!  
**Byrnes:** _click_  

That went great! I'd acquired the ace the Twins really needed, and all it took was some guys who weren't going to play this year anyway. Prospects? They're replaceable. But pitchers who make a lot of money and are regarded as an Ace? Those come around awfully rarely. And I'd got one!

I think I drank that champagne a little too quickly, though, because suddenly I felt a little bit lightheaded and also a little sleepy -- nothing wrong with a celebratory nap, I thought. The deal wouldn't go away while I dozed. Byrnes-y would never do that to me. I sprawled out on the couch and shut my eyes, dreams of sugar plums and championship trophies and pork chops dancing in my head.

I awoke not too much later, just a few hours probably, with a newly-printed piece of paper sitting on the table next to me. I picked it up and groggily read it over, squinting at the words assaulting my pretty eyes. It was an announcement of the Haren trade!

Popping up, I sat upright to read the report in the properly triumphant manner -- only to learn seconds later that Haren had indeed been traded, but not to the Twins. Instead, he was headed west, to _The Los Angeles Angels Of Anaheim California Angels_, or some such ridiculous place. What treachery was this?! That devious snake Byrnes had tricked me!

**Great Bill Smith:** Kathy! Get in here!  
**Stacy:** What is it, Mr Smith?  
**Great Bill Smith:** That dirty Byrnes took my trade proposal and got himself a better deal with the Angels! That two-timing, dirt-eating ... oh, I'm just so mad! I'm never dealing with him again!  
**Stacy:** To be fair, Josh Byrnes isn't the GM of the Diamondbacks.  
**Great Bill Smith:** _Staring blankly at her_ ... Huh?  
**Stacy:** He was fired a while ago. I tried to warn you --  
**Great Bill Smith:** No you didn't. I'd remember it. I never forget a thing like that.  
**Stacy:** Um, is there anything else.  
**Great Bill Smith:** No. Wait, yes. I need a pork chop.  

What's-her-name left, and shut the door behind her. I practically keeled over, unable to believe what had just happened. I'd gone from making the trade of the century to nothing in the blink of an eye, and I didn't know what to do with myself. What a day! I could sure go for another nap.

I'd deal with that lying Byrnes another day.
