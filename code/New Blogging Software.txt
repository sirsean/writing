So I've written some new blogging software, and have migrated Sean's Sports over to it. We'll see how this works out.

The point of the new software is to be faster than Wordpress -- especially on Dreamhost, which has pathetically bad database performance. With this new blogging platform, the database has been thrown out entirely.

The content is stored on the filesystem in HTML (translated from Markdown when it's posted). A small amount of metadata is stored in ini files.

And there are no forms on the site; you can't leave comments, and there is no admin section. I post to it with a small client application that translates a Markdown txt file to HTML and uploads it to the server. This simplifies things tremendously, and is one more (large) section of the attack surface that I shouldn't have to worry about at all.

So ... maybe I'll be posting on here more often. It's not baseball season, so the odds of non-Twins thoughts is as high as it'll ever be.
