> Niners (+7) over VIKINGS
> Ithaca, N.Y., reader David Marks writes, "I would love the opportunity to sponsor your 'Underdog Lock of the Week.' I believe this would be a great opportunity for self-exposure as I begin my search for a premium summer internship. Please consider my offer of $10 per week to call the section, 'The David Marks Cornell University Junior Who Needs a Great Summer Internship Underdog of the Week.'"

> David, I can't take your money. Mainly because you're living in Ithaca. Some day you'll come to the West Coast, realize you could have gone to college here and just start sobbing like Rocky during Mickey's funeral. In fact, I feel so bad for you that I'm letting you sponsor my Week 3 underdog lock for free. I love the Niners this week for three reasons: First, they're better than you think -- good running game, good defense, well-coached. Second, the Vikings haven't played anyone you could even call "mediocre" yet. And third, I want to see what happens to Brett Favre with a hungry defense coming after him every down. The Niners seem hungry to me. Hence, my David Marks Cornell University Junior Who Needs a Great Summer Internship Underdog Lock of the Week: San Fran 23, Minnesota 20.

Is it just me, or did Simmons have it picked almost exactly correctly _except_ for the fact that, with the score 24-20, Brett Favre threw a 40 yard touchdown strike to the back of the endzone to a triple-covered receiver with 00:02 left on the clock to win the game and make it 27-24?
