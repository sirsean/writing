On the bus this morning, I noticed another example of something that happens with what I think is stunning frequency:

The two fattest, most disgustingly immobile people on the bus plant themselves next to the exit door, completely blocking off the passage from the front half of the bus to the back, and preventing _anyone_ from getting off. When someone does try to get off, these people will just look at the person who wants to get past with some sort of confusion on their faces, as if it's inconceivable that someone might want to get off the bus. They never move out of the way, and people are forced to kind of muscle/wiggle their way past.

It never ceases to amaze me that this happens.

After I lowered my shoulder and blew through the two defensive-tackle-sized women who were doing it this morning, I found myself wondering what Adrian Peterson would do.

There's not really much of a hole between these people, so obviously Peterson would be comfortable smashing into them. But he also doesn't seem to try to actually get _between_ defensive lineman -- he runs right into one. Sometimes it works, usually it doesn't.

Sure, if Adrian Peterson were _actually_ on the bus, people might get out of the way for him. You know, since he's famous.

But for some reason, it made me happy to think about Peterson lowering his shoulder into one of those amorphous blobs of human flesh, perhaps lodging it in the door of the bus, crushing it like it's a hapless defensive player on, for example, the Lions.

On the other hand, why would Adrian Peterson ride the bus?
