Just days after [Adrian Peterson was stopped going 109 MPH in a 55 MPH zone](http://www.inentertainment.co.uk/20091205/adrian-peterson-caught-speeding-109-mph-in-a-55-mph-speed-zone/), Bernard Berrian [was _also_ stopped doing 104 MPH in a 60 MPH zone](http://www.startribune.com/sports/vikings/blogs/78578432.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUgOy9cP3DieyckcUsI).

Normally, I don't care too much about this kind of thing; I think they should be treated just like any other citizen who does something like this: given a big and expensive ticket, possibly lose their licenses (depending on prior transgressions), and they shouldn't get their names in the paper.

But this is a _lot_ of speeding -- normally when you're caught going 100 MPH it's in a 70 zone and/or on an interstate highway, without many other cars around; that doesn't seem to be the case here. And _more importantly_, this is now **two Vikings skill position players openly flouting the law**, mere days apart.

Should we get really worked up about the fact that the Vikings' on-field success has gone to their heads? Is it really a problem that celebrities and superstars and millionaires live by a different set of rules than we do?* What's the big deal, right, since nobody got hurt?

_* I think most people would probably say, "Yes, it's a problem." But most people aren't even here right now, so I'm just going to keep on rolling._

I'm sure other, better people will cover these pressing issues. What _I_ want to know is this:

**Why are they in such a hurry?**

What could possibly be so important that these guys have to be moving this fast to get it? Did they get a phone call from their drug dealer saying his inventory was low and they needed to get there immediately to make sure their stash didn't go dry? Are all the Vikings players participating in some sort of scavenger hunt, or contest wherein they have to travel around the city and do tricks and get from place to place in a time-sensitive fashion?

If it were the latter, kind of like Amazing Race or something, they could make a reality TV show out of it, and you'd definitely watch. Tell me you wouldn't. That's right.
