I'd like to propose a corollary to the Ewing Theory: the Incident.

The Ewing Theory states that a team can get signifantly better once its best player leaves -- it's an indictment of that player, who is good but makes the team worse, normally thought to be something he lacks on the field or does to affect the team's chemistry.

The Incident Corollary adds that if the player left the team due to an incident -- especially one involving drugs, guns, and teammates -- the team can bond together and play well above their heads for an extended stretch. Just like Tennessee has done without Tyler Smith.

Obviously, Smith was having an insidious influence on the clubhouse atmosphere.
